            <p class="body pad-s">
              I write this article knowing that there exist multiple blogs online on the same topic. I also write this article knowing that the heads up that I myself needed coming into ECE is missing in all those articles. This article is aimed to bridge that gap. The gap being: no Indian international student in ECE with a strong academic background in high school wrote blogs
            </p>
            <p class="header2 pad-s">First some background on my academics before 1A ECE</p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              I am a student that prepared for entry into the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), and I say this not just to describe my academics but also since my preparation was and still remains a big part of my life. I prepared for IIT for four consecutive years after joining a coaching institute for the same<br>
              <br>
              This preparation was intense. The daily routine (in 11th and 12th) was even more insane:<br>
              - woke up at 6
              <br>
              - went to school at 7:30 (4 out of 5 weekdays)
              <br>
              - returned at 2:30
              <br>
              - went to coaching class at 4
              <br>
              - spent about 4 hours learning
              <br>
              - returned around 9
              <br>
              - studied after returning from coaching class
              <br>
              - slept at 12 if not later
              <br><br>
              Over and above school days, summer vacations were spent 10am to 6pm at the coaching centre.<br><br>
              Due to this intense routine, class 11th and 12th was over like a breeze and I graduated CBSE with 95.4% among the best in my school.<br><br>

              As for IIT, things turned out a little different due to various reasons and I got around 4k rank in JEE mains and 8k in advanced.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="header2 pad-s">Now let's get to ECE</p>
            <p class="body pad-s">
              Not lying: it was a breeze. Barely went to classes, passed with flying colors. 1B is not looking so easy, but let's see what happens.
              Let's look at the 1A courses:<br><br>
              <b>ECE150</b>: I learnt C++ in CBSE, so programming in C++ was something I was comfortable in.<br>
              -insert instructor approved answerer in this class
              </p>
              <p class="body pad-s">
                <div class="item">
                    <img src="images/piazza.png"/>
                    <img src="images/instructor.png"/>
                    <span class="caption">Instructor Approved answerer!</span>
                </div>
              </p>
              <p class="body pad-s">
              This class was fun, getting challenged to cover all the test cases was a fun experience but getting this stamp of approval was better<br><br>

              <b>ECE105</b>: IIT preparation paid out its dividends here. As the class struggled to wrap their head around moment of inertia, I was acing the quizzes. This course is entirely mechanics and kinematics - to the level of JEE mains and maybe 5-8% harder but nothing like JEE advanced. My final grade is a reflection of my IIT preparation - although the course was insanely curved.<br><br>

              <b>CHE102</b>: In class participation is a pain, since you have to stay alert at the times of the lecture even if it is from home. But in the end I got a 100% provided the professor took best 14 lectures out of 16. As for the course: physical chemistry is all there is to it. The help session proved useful for this class though, since the last help session was basically the entire course revised.<br><br>

              <b>MATH115</b>: This was the course that I had to study for the most, although it's still not much coming from me. Wrapping my head around eigen values, sub-spaces among others was a bit difficult but once I set out to finish the course syllabus, I was done in about 4 hours. I expected a little more in this course provided it's not as high as I expected, but most of Indian friends have the same opinion so I think it might have been very strict correction to preserve the course average.<br><br>

              <b>MATH117</b>: This course only goes up to integration and volume of curves rotated about an axis in Calculus. If you've done CBSE level integration, then this course should be a breeze. Again though, I feel like I did worse in the course than expected but still better than all of my other Canadian friends<br><br>
